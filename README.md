# cats_app
Just download the project and you're good to go ðŸš€

Execute in any simulator you prefer.

Some cute cats will be displayed on your screen. 
If the ones displayed are not the ones you like, you can always pull to refresh, and new cats will appear.

A small clarification: 

- You may see a little delay when loading the cats images. That's because external services are called in order to retrieve them and all cats are shown together once everything gets loaded.
